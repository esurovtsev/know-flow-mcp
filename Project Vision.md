# KnowFlow MCP Tool ‚Äì Comprehensive Product Specification

## üöÄ Project Vision

**KnowFlow** is designed as a versatile, unified knowledge retrieval tool operating according to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Its primary purpose is enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Claude or any other MCP-compatible LLM, by providing structured external knowledge on demand.

The core concept behind KnowFlow is simulating a simplified version of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, enabling LLMs to dynamically fetch context or domain-specific information from external knowledge bases, resulting in precise, context-aware responses.

---

## üéØ Core Objectives

- Allow MCP-compatible LLMs to determine when external context or additional knowledge is required.
- Facilitate automatic reformulation of user queries into structured knowledge retrieval requests.
- Provide structured and context-rich responses clearly indicating the source location, document title, and modification date.
- Establish a foundational structure enabling future integration with multiple external knowledge sources (Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, Linear, Jira, etc.).

---

## üß© Scope of the First Version (MVP)

The initial implementation of KnowFlow is intentionally simple, designed solely as a proof of concept and to establish a foundation for further development:

- **Local operation only**: KnowFlow MCP will run entirely locally, without network calls to external services.
- **Simple file-based retrieval**: Information will be retrieved exclusively from plain text (`.txt`) and markdown (`.md`) files stored in a specific local directory.
- **Basic keyword search**: Implements a straightforward keyword-based search to identify relevant content.
- **Structured response format**: Responses must contain clear metadata enabling seamless interpretation by LLMs.

### Example Response Format

```json
[
  {
    "source": {
      "location": "local_file",
      "title": "architecture-notes.md"
    },
    "modified": "2024-03-14",
    "snippet": "We agreed to consolidate all backend modules under a single monorepo using Nx."
  }
]
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Future Expansion Possibilities

The foundational design explicitly anticipates integration with additional knowledge sources such as:

- **Notion** pages
- **Confluence** documentation
- **Google Docs** documents
- **Linear and Jira** issues or tickets
- Other popular knowledge repositories utilized by developers and organizations.

Future integrations will consistently use the established structured response format, clearly defining the source type, document title, date, and content snippet.
